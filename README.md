# RiotEfficiencyTester
A program for calculating the most efficient spell in the game League of Legends, created by Riot Games.

Currently being refactored for style and general improvements due to putting this together in a weekend.

In the future, I plan to make this more usable for everyone instead of just my own devices. I plan to use my recent internship at SAS to incorporate this into a Command Line Interface using their more formal REST API Standards.

UPDATE 02/2017: Currently attempting to translate this to golang, but since the Riot API is still somewhat primitively broken in some cases, may have to put this on hold.
